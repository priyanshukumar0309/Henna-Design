    "title": "From Kolkata and Varanasi to Stockholm",
    "artistName": "Supriya Gupta",
    "paragraph1": "Growing up surrounded by the rich tradition of mehndi in the vibrant cities of Kolkata and Varanasi, I learned that henna is more than decoration—it's a ritual, a blessing, a story written on skin.",
    "paragraph2": "As a doctor by profession, I bring the same precision and care to my henna artistry. My passion for art and healing intertwines beautifully—where medicine heals the body, henna art heals the soul. After moving to Stockholm, I discovered something unexpected: the Nordic appreciation for minimalism didn't diminish the art—it refined it. Clean lines, intentional negative space, and purposeful design became my new language.",
    "paragraph3": "Today, we create henna that honors both worlds. Each design carries the soul of Indian heritage while speaking the elegant, understated language of Scandinavian aesthetics. As a professional henna artist in Stockholm, I specialize in bridal henna, mehndi designs, and henna parties for the diverse communities across Södermalm, Vasastan, Kungsholmen, and all Stockholm areas.",
